## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a relational database designed for managing inventory and operations within a pharmacy. The database supports the pharmacyâ€™s internal processes, including medicine stock management, supplier details, customer prescriptions, and order tracking.

The project was developed using SQL and includes tables, relationships, and constraints that form an efficient system for managing essential data in the pharmaceutical sector.

### Main Objectives

- Efficient database design
- Query optimization
- Relational data modeling

### Features

- **Medicine Management:** Recording essential medicine details such as generic and brand names, dosage, stock levels, and expiration dates.
- **Supplier Management:** Maintaining records of pharmaceutical suppliers, including contact information and payment terms.
- **Pharmacy Locations:** Managing multiple pharmacy branches and their inventory levels.
- **Order Processing:** Tracking orders placed with suppliers, including statuses (pending, delivered, canceled).
- **Customer Prescription Management:** Storing and linking prescriptions to patients and doctors.

### Schema Diagram

You can view the updated database schema diagram in the main folder of this repository: **Pharmacy_Inventory_ERD_diagram.png** or **Pharmacy_Inventory_ERD_diagram.pdf**

## Technologies Used

- **Database:** SQL (compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
- **Tools:** SQLDeveloper, MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin

## How to use

### Prerequisites:

- An SQL-compatible database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
- An SQL editor (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, pgAdmin)

### Steps to run:

1. **Download the SQL file:** Access the file **Pharmacy_Inventory_script.sql** from this repository.
2. **Import the database:** Load the SQL file into a compatible database management system.
3. **Run the queries:** Execute the SQL scripts to create tables and populate the database with necessary data.
4. **Practice exercises:** Access the file **Pharmacy_Inventory_practice_exercises.sql** and execute to observe how complex SQL queries are implemented for extracting, analyzing, and manipulating data in order to meet specific management requirements.
